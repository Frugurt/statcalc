#version 0.2 POGGERS!

item_simulation.py is the main script, use
```
python item_simulation.py item_file [--tries NUM_TRIES]
```
where item file is a JSON file describing your item, see /examples

Alternatively you can launch the GUI by using
```
python main.py
```
there's barely any input validation so if you try something funny you will get funny results too ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Requirements are numpy (because using random function from STL is not cool LuL) and pyqt5 for GUI version only.

If you don't want to install python and stuff, there's a poorly frozen version of GUI available [here](https://www116.zippyshare.com/v/gXTCqDah/file.html). It might work on Windows.
