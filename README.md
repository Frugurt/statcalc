Well, there it is, folks!

Notebook file has some examples and explanations and I usually work from there, but nothing stops you from just importing two .py files and doing everything in regular python console.

TODO

1. Make it so users dont have to manually define what each item can roll and how each stat works
either turn statlist.py into a complete database of all items or pull it from whatever API, ask Riv idk

2. Add possibility to specify which affixes you DONT want, i.e. LPK for SMH builds, %chance to cc for necro or APD users
right now you need to calculate probability of item with any stat in that slot then with undesirable stat and then substract one from another

3. Add interface OMEGALUL
